# CSE216_Term_Project
Term project for level 2 term 2. It was a collaboration between me & Tanveer Hossain Munim.

Crackwatch - If you don't know what it is, it is a website which keeps track of games, when they will be released, if they are cracked or not, if cracked then who cracked the game, where is the game originally purchased from etc. Our project also covers all these parts. It will also have a user with password mechanism, follow games, rate games and much more!

This project uses the language Python for Django backend. For frontend, it uses HTML & CSS. The database that is used is Oracle. The images that are used here are not mine. They are taken from the internet, all credits to them.
